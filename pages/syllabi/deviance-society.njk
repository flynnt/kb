  <p>What is deviance? That is a good question, and one which this course is designed to answer. This course will
    examine how society produces deviance, how it tries to reduce deviance, and how it deals with those who act in
    unconventional ways â€“ those we call deviants. We will read and discuss some of the best writings available on the
    subject of deviance, learn about specific deviant groups in society, and explore our own acts of deviance. </p>
